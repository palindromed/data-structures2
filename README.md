This repo holds sample code for some classic data structures.

It's a joint project of Hannah Krager and A.J. Wohlfert.
______________

Insertion sort algorithm has been included in the src directory and demonstrates best and worst case scenario performance time.


=======
The merge sort algorithm has been included in the src directory and demonstrates best and worst case scenario performance time.
The merge sort algorithm recursively splits the list into smaller lists, sorts and then merges the two lists.
Radix sort algorithm has been included in the src directory and demonstrates best and worst case scenario performance time.
